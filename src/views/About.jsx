            Hey there, fellow food lovers! My name is Elly, and this website
            is my exam project, where I bring the world of delicious homemade
            recipes straight to your screen. I’m on a mission to make cooking
            fun, easy, and absolutely mouth-watering! 🎉
          </p>

          <h3>Why DishDelights? 🤔</h3>
          <p>

          <h3>The Exam Journey 🎓</h3>
          <p>
            This website isn't just about food; it’s also about learning. As part
            of my exam project, I built DishDelights from scratch, adding
            cool features like recipe search, categories, and favorites. I had a
            blast working on this, and I hope my hard work earns me a decent grade
            (fingers crossed! 🤞).
          </p>

          <h3>Thank You for Visiting! ❤️</h3>
          <p>
            Whether you're here for the food, fun, or just curious about my project,
            I truly appreciate it! So go ahead, explore the recipes, save your
            favorites, and most importantly—enjoy cooking!
